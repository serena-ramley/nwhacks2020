# MP Transparency

MP Transparency is our project for NWHacks2020. Our aim is to empower Canadian voters by giving them the information necessary to hold their political representatives accountable. We used a Python/Flask backend to track MP's attendance from vote records taken from OpenParliament's APIs and gain insights on Bills of the House of Commons with Azure Cognitive Services. This information was then displayed on our React frontend.
